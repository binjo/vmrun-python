-*0 Intro 0*-

This is a python wrapper of vmrun.exe, which is used to control Vmware. Its idea is
based on Alexander Sotirov's vmrun-ruby. Currently it only support vmware 6.0 or
higher version.

-*0 Usage 0*-

import vmrun
vm = vmrun.Vmrun( r'full\path\to\your\foo.vmx', 'username', 'pass' )
vm.start()
vm.suspend()
vm.stop()

More fun refer to the source :-)

-*0 Known issue 0*-

1. When call revertToSnapshot, it may mess the vmware's vmx file, the Vmware may refuse
   to start. If this is the case, edit your vmx file, remove the following line:
       checkpoint.vmState = "foo-SnapshotXX.vmsn"
   edit vmx file:
       ide0:0.fileName = "foo-XXXXX.vmdk"
   to the original disk file
       ide0:0.fileName = "foo.vmdk"
